# CSCI 443 Stage 5 Code

The python file listed in this GitHub contains the data gathered for Stage 5 of the CSCI443 project. 
This code uses the matplotlib library. As such, because there are multiple graphs produced, you will need to close the graph pop-up before viewing the next one.

The means and standard deviations of the data are outputed to the console. 

## Running the Program
Simply run `python stage5.py` in a console window or instead run it in your favorite IDE.
